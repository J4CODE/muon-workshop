# Demo Scripts

## 1 Services

* export LEVEL=error
* Run `hello-world-node`
* muon i
* muon rpc hello-world-node /
* --raw & JQ
* run `hello-world-java`
* muon rpc
* muon stream
* run `tick-tock-client`
* show it receiving data from hello-world-java

## 2 MuonJS

* make to run webserver
* show the html.

*TODO*

## 3 Photon

* muon d
* muon i photon
* muon rpc photon /stream-names
* muon replay XX
* muon emit
* muon replay hot
* muon replay cold
* muon replay from [order-id]

* run http-adaptor
* muon replay requests

* run events-jvm
* add an rpcish api to get the event count.

## 4 First Newton - Streaming Views

* show http-adaptor, emitting access info
* run http-adaptor.
* run `newton-streaming-views`
* show view code
* hit the url
* query the view
* show streaming version of the view

## 5 Complex Logic - Aggregate Roots

* run `newton-aggregate`
* show UserListView
* show AR. explain event sourcing, explain stream links
* muon rpc newton-aggregates / '{"name":"someone"}'
* muon rpc newton-aggregates /user '{"id": "X"}'
* Do the something update
* Add a last message field to `User`
* muon rpc /  - see new schema.
* show stream endpoint - observe updates

## 6 Process Managers

We want a workflow of

* when user created, request approval and provisioning by sending a slack message
* user is provisioned in some external system. use muon cli to report it is finished
* use slack to say "account is provisioned"
* once both are done, process finished.

Show demo
* show system, same as before
* added workflow steps to `User`
* create a new user
* email sent to user (actually, shown in console)
* email sent to admin (actually, shown in console)
* Can confirm account and provision in any order
* confirm via `muon rpc newton-user-registration /user/confirm '{"id":"xxx"}'
