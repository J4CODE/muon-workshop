# Muon Intro Workshop

To run the systems in this workshop you need to have a muon development environment setup.

First, follow the instructions at https://github.com/muoncore/muon-starter

This will give you a Muon CLI and a set of docker containers running some services that support some of the demos.

The demos are as follows

## 1-services

Basic muon services, showing message oriented, defined protocols in action. Polyglot.

RPCish and streaming.

## 2-muonjs

Intro muon.js, show the routing possibilities of a Muon system and how it can run happily in a browser.

## 3-photon-events

Introduce the core event protocols and the service that backs them, Photon.

Event sourcing, stream processing.

## 4-first-newton-streaming

Introduce the Newton application framework that sits on top of Muon and Photon. Currently Spring focused.

Use Newton to build CQRS style materialised views from the event streams in Photon.

## 5-aggregate-roots

Implement event sourced aggregate roots in Newton that can easily combine with stream processed views.

## 6-process-manager

Combine events and distributed coordination in the form of a process manager. Layer a business process on top of
domains instead of hacking around in domain services.
